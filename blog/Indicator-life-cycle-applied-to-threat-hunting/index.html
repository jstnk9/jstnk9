These concepts are as follows.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Atomic indicators</strong>: Atomic indicators are obtained based on the context of an intrusion that has taken place. The “problem” with this type of indicators is that they do not have to be exclusive activity of a specific adversary, i.e. an atomic indicator can be identified in several intrusions of different adversaries. Some examples of these indicators are IP addresses, domains, the name of a path of a domain…</p></li><li><p><strong>Computed indicators</strong>: The concept of a calculated indicator is quite confusing. These indicators are developed from attributes that occur in an incident. For example, a hash of a file that has been seen in an incident can be calculated, so its MD5, SHA1… are calculated indicators. Another example could be a regular expression, which we can develop to detect something specific.</p></li><li><p><strong>behavioral indicators</strong>: These indicators are composed of a combination of the two types described above. For example, within this category we could state the following; “Adversaries established a C&amp;C <!-- -->[IP and/or C&amp;C domain]<!-- --> with the machine compromised by the <!-- -->[MD5 Hash]<!-- --> malware. Communications were executed at an interval of <!-- -->[Time interval]<!-- --> between client and server. They could be identified by searching for the regular expression <!-- -->[Identifying regular expression]<!-- --> in the proxy logs.”</p></li></ul><p>As you can imagine, this last type of indicator is the most valuable, as it has an associated context of what has happened and combines the atomic and calculated indicators. In addition, it is also easy to extract possible MITRE techniques and tactics to better understand what actions are being taken.</p><p><img src="https://jstnk9.github.io/jstnk9/img/blog-indicator-life-cycle/hunt_1.png" alt="Image_1"></p><p>Now that we know the types of indicators that can be used in the indicator life cycle process, it is time to explain how the indicator life cycle works.</p><p>It consists of three main phases or stages, being the phases of developed, matured and used. In addition, this process is essential to involve people, processes and technology, which makes it really dynamic and useful in different operations, such as threat hunting.</p><p><img src="https://jstnk9.github.io/jstnk9/img/blog-indicator-life-cycle/hunt_2.png" alt="Image_2"></p><p>Applying this model to our threat hunting activities will provide us with the following capabilities:</p><ol><li>Generate internal threat intelligence</li><li>Implement a stable pivoting process</li><li>Identify new indicators from other indicators</li></ol><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="from-revealed-to-mature">From revealed to mature<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#from-revealed-to-mature" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>This first phase has different sources as input. In the image above, some of the sources that could be a source of information to start the cycle are shown. For example, external (or internal) reports, intelligence sources, SIEM or any other monitoring tool, such as an IDS.</p><p>The above mentioned sources will carry with them indicators, which should be subjected to an examination, which will consist of historically searching our available internal data sources to see whether or not such an indicator was observed in the past ( <a href="https://joseliyo-jstnk.medium.com/threat-hunting-but-where-and-what-collection-management-framework-33a2790f976f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> see my post about collection management framework </a> ). In case the result is positive, further investigation is required to determine whether the activity was malicious or not.</p><p>With a positive result, countermeasures for <em>detection</em> (in case the indicator becomes active again) and mitigation must be implemented internally, i.e., we <strong>not only want to detect but also actively prevent it from achieving its objectives.</strong></p><p><img src="https://jstnk9.github.io/jstnk9/img/blog-indicator-life-cycle/hunt_3.png" alt="Image_3"></p><p>An indicator is considered mature when malicious activity has been retrospectively identified and detection and mitigation countermeasures have been implemented.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="from-mature-to-utilized">From mature to utilized<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#from-mature-to-utilized" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>An indicator is <strong>utilized</strong> when the detection countermeasures are positive, i.e. the indicator has been identified by performing some action and is considered to have been used to detect a possible scenario that in principle should be malicious.</p><p>It is therefore important that the indicators have detection countermeasures in place, otherwise they can never be considered used, thus breaking the cycle completely and being unable to identify new indicators.</p><p><img src="https://jstnk9.github.io/jstnk9/img/blog-indicator-life-cycle/hunt_4.png" alt="Image_4"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="from-utilized-to-revealed">From utilized to revealed<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#from-utilized-to-revealed" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>This stage of the cycle requires a great deal of interaction from the analysts as they will have to carry out an analysis of the events that have been detected in the previous stage. The reason is simple, the indicator itself is only a small portion of what could be an intrusion or attempt, i.e., it will be necessary to investigate the whole context of what could be happening and build a complete picture of the operation that the adversaries are carrying out.</p><p>During this analysis, it is very likely that new indicators will appear that were not previously known, so these indicators will have to be moved to the disclosed state again to start the cycle.</p><p><img src="https://jstnk9.github.io/jstnk9/img/blog-indicator-life-cycle/hunt_5.png" alt="Image_5"></p><p>In those cases where a large number of new indicators are identified, or regardless of the quantity, quality should be prioritized. This means that there will be indicators that have more impact and more clearly detect malicious activity. An example could be a domain path, assuming that a malware communicates with baddomain.com/data?systeminfo=value, it is possible that we have seen another domain communicating with the same path, either because the malware incorporates several hardcoded domains in its code or any other reason, so it would be important to mature indicators to detect new behavior of other communications with /data?systeminfo=.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="applying-the-cycle-in-threat-hunting-activities">Applying the cycle in threat hunting activities<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#applying-the-cycle-in-threat-hunting-activities" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The entire life cycle of the indicators explained so far has a place in the famous threat hunting process, where the team first performs hypothesis generation by prioritizing the threats that could have the greatest impact on its activity. The next step is the pure hunting activity, where the other cycle can be implemented to structure the work even more and achieve objectives in a more effective way.</p><p><img src="https://jstnk9.github.io/jstnk9/img/blog-indicator-life-cycle/hunt_6.png" alt="Image_6"></p><p>The discovery phase could also be framed within the life cycle of the indicators, more specifically with the mature stage, which would be those cases where some past behavior has been detected with the hunt being carried out by the team.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="case-study">Case study<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#case-study" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Let’s imagine that we are generating different scenarios internally to carry out hunting activities.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="1--hypothesis-generation">#1 — Hypothesis generation<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#1--hypothesis-generation" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>We are interested in identifying the creation of scheduled tasks in the systems in the past, because an adversary who has special motivation in our company’s sector could materialize an incident.</p><p><em>Objective</em>: Identify suspicious scheduled tasks in the systems.</p><p><em>Searches</em>: Windows events 4698 and 4702.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="2---hunting">#2 - Hunting<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#2---hunting" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The team begins to perform threat hunting activities on the systems using whatever technology is available, be it EDR consoles, opensource tools, SIEM, etc…</p><p>A positive is identified in a system, where a scheduled task is checked.</p><p><img src="https://jstnk9.github.io/jstnk9/img/blog-indicator-life-cycle/hunt_7.png" alt="Image_7"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="3---revealed-to-mature">#3 - Revealed to mature<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#3---revealed-to-mature" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The finding in this case can be verified as a scheduled task masked with a name of “Mozilla Firefox Update” has been enabled by launching via command line a file named “jstnk.exe” found in the AppData directory.</p><p>At this point we would have two indicators, a calculated one and a behavioral one.</p><p><strong>Computed indicator</strong>: MD5 hash of the file jstnk.exe</p><p><strong>behavioral Indicator</strong>: An adversary sets the scheduled task “Mozilla Firefox Update” (T1053.005) which executes the file jstnk.exe <!-- -->[MD5]<!-- -->.</p><p>With both indicators, it is necessary to check retrospectively whether similar persistence has been performed on other systems in the corporate network, either with the same malware called jstnk.exe or using the same scheduled task technique.</p><p>If new computers are detected where persistence has been performed using T1053.005, countermeasures for detection and mitigation are therefore implemented.</p><p><strong>Detection countermeasures</strong>: Execution of the command “schtasks /create “, focusing on files referenced in Appdata.
