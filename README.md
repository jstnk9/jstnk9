### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Jose Luis, although everyone knows me as Joseliyo. I'm mainly focused in Cyber Threat Intelligence, but I love converting the intelligence in actionable information and detections. For that reason, I try to automate many tasks and create open source contributions in terms of scripts or other stuff.

You can follow me on Twitter [![Twitter URL](https://img.shields.io/twitter/url/https/twitter.com/bukotsunikki.svg?style=social&label=Follow%20%40Joseliyo_Jstnk)](https://twitter.com/Joseliyo_Jstnk)
